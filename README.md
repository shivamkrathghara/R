Text Modelling Project - 
The dataset consists of the titles (variable title) and abstracts (variable abstract) of papers retrieved in a Pubmed search.
Each search result is labeled with whether the paper is a clinical trial testing a drug therapy for cancer (variable trial). 
These labels were obtained by two people reviewing each 
search result and accessing the actual paper if necessary, as part of a literature review of clinical trials testing drug therapies for advanced and metastatic breast cancer.

Decision Tree Model has been applied to predict from the paper The results obtained were 
Accuracy :  0.7580645
Sensitivity :  0.6612245
Specificity :  0.8338658
AUC : 0.8371063
